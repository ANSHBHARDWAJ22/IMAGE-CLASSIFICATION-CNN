1. Data Preparation
Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of labeled images (e.g., cats and dogs).
Data Augmentation: Apply transformations (rotation, scaling, flipping) to increase the diversity of the training dataset.
Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Building the CNN Architecture
Input Layer: Define the input shape that matches the dimensions of the images.
Convolutional Layers: Apply multiple convolutional layers to extract features from the images. Each convolutional layer typically includes:
Convolution operation with a set of filters.
Activation function (usually ReLU) to introduce non-linearity.
Pooling (usually max pooling) to reduce the spatial dimensions.
Fully Connected Layers: Flatten the output from the convolutional layers and pass it through fully connected layers to perform the final classification.
Output Layer: The final layer with neurons equal to the number of classes (e.g., 2 for cats and dogs) and a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
3. Compiling the Model
Loss Function: Choose an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification).
Optimizer: Select an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to minimize the loss function.
Metrics: Define metrics (e.g., accuracy) to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Training the Model
Feed Forward: Pass the training data through the network to compute the output.
Backpropagation: Calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights and update the weights using the optimizer.
Epochs: Repeat the feed forward and backpropagation steps for a specified number of epochs.
Batch Size: Use mini-batches of data to update the weights, which helps in stabilizing and speeding up the training process.
5. Evaluating the Model
Validation: Evaluate the model on the validation set during training to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
Testing: After training, assess the model's performance on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to new data.
6. Fine-Tuning and Optimization
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to improve model performance.
Regularization: Implement techniques like dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting.
7. Deployment
Saving the Model: Save the trained model to disk.
Inference: Use the saved model to make predictions on new, unseen images.
